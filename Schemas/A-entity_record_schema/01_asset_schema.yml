      UUID has a distinct advantage over a simple serial number - we do not need a script to check for repetition. For instance, when onboarding assets from another system or a spreadsheet, we don't need to check the WMS to see if the ID was already taken.

      This field will be populated by a rule processor, either inside Maximo or operating outside with integration to Maximo. An example of the inferred class is "high-pressure boiler".

      This data field is not nullable becauase the lack of knowledge is explicitly expressed as "missing" or "lost", and the non-existence is expressed as "planned" or "removed from possession".

      - not applicable
    $comment: |
      The "not applicable" value is being represented explicitly in the value list, because when we are reporting on equipment uptime, we need to know about the periods in which the operating state is not applicable. For example, if the asset is not assigned to any role, organization, or anyone.

    userEditable: false
    $comment: |
      Though it is more elegant to represent the location of a part as the space of a larger asset, this would involve setting up a rule to automatically create a spatial location entity.  Though this is achievable in the work management system, it is no in every other system where we enter assets (e.g. EIW). Also, to always says that the asset is located in a space of a larger asset is not semantically correct. Sometimes, the asset is not so much "in" another asset then being "a part of" it.

    $comment: |
      This field is commonly used when the asset is a part of a skid, structural tank, or switchgear cabinet, in which the asset parent in the system hierarchy should be the line entity. As such we will using this field to track that the asset is also a part of a phyical assembly.  We would also be using this field to capture a serialized rotating component as a part of another discrete asset. This field can also be used to indicate an asset membership in a Defined Collection of Assets.

  OEM serial:
    oneof: [type: string, type:null]
    description: The serial number, affixed on the asset, designated by the manufacturer.
    $comment: |
      Outcome of TH's discussion within ASMP: The serial number is only populated when an asset experiences a movement (except for movement for removal), or when it is being check into a storeroom.
      Therefore, when the value of the OEM serial is null, it represents the fact that we do not know what the serial number is (and whether it has a serial number at all).

  =========================================

  OPEN AND TODO ITEMS:

    []  - add RULE: asset can be assigned to an asset collection and a group or a person at the same time (though it cannot be assigned to a discrete asset role and a group at the same time)

    [] - rule on location inheritance from role

    [v] - rules on what role, and assets, can be the child of what others. 


    [] - Need to have a different set of data entry (i.e. what is nullable) requirement for Linear assets
    
    
    [] (April 26 Review) assigned to a vehicle is missing - this is a satellite storeroom
          ANS: May 6th: TH: I am covering this with the existing property "located in space"
  
    [] RULE: a general requirement to print error messages


  ================================================

  REVIEW ITEMS (incl completed open items:):
    
    [v] - specify field photos
      AK also supports this

    [N/A] Discussion intention: 
      - for the implementation, we need to fully realize at least one type of activity as a transaction (or pure function) that changes the state of a property of a record. I suggest configuring the following:
        - given the completion of any activity, present the options to change the condition and the availability state of the asset.
        - given the completion of an subclasse of "move and replace" activity, the asset's location and/or physical State should be changed by the transaction
      
    [N/A] Disucussion:
      - Do we want the option to have separate groups being represented for routine maintenace vs reactive maintnenace. Like in D&C. 

    [OPEN] RULE: (May 10 Review) rule suggestion: an asset going into storage should not be assigned to any role or any one.
      [?] Annette,
        Would you want to impmement a) spaces designated for storage or b) real maximo store rooms. Note that option a) seems simple, but involves some complexity for representing assets that are used inside a storage space. (Despite the fact they are inside the storage spaces, they may still be assigned to a role or someone and may still need to be maintained.)

    [V] RULE: check only one asset can be assigned to a role
    
    [?] - Need to incorporate information about ownership from TWAG (whether it is City, private,)
      [] Tony to engage feedback: 
        - Review the two options for "asset owner organization"
        - To take up the proposal of using universal metadata for the value list.
    
    [V] RULE: if from GIS then populate GeoID
      datafield "TWAG asset" is added for this purpose
    
    [V] I separated "privately owned" as its own datafield, with the intent to avoid the confusion
    
    [?] Candice: what does private ownership mean? It is owned by a private citizen or organization or both?

    [V] (April 26 Review) How do we name "non-manufactured" assets? 
          PL: follow what PCS stand is doing. TH: structural asset is the majority and they can be named like a role.
          [] lets review: 
            Do we need to have the year in which it is constructed. I think so, in reporting, it helps to identify the identify of the asset, among a series in history serving in the same role. 

    [?] - OPEN ISSUE from Debbie: Will true “safety” be identified on an asset record (hazards, precautions, loto)?
      Consider adding the one of the following sub-schema to the asset schema. Note the all fields would be populated by the legislative compliance reasoner.
