        $comment: |
          UUID has a distinct advantage over a simple serial number - we do not need a script to check for repetition. For instance, when onboarding assets from another system or a spreadsheet, we don't need to check the WMS to see if the ID was already taken.

      To data architect and implementer: the "not applicable" value is important, because when we are reporting on equipment uptime, we need to know about the periods in which the operating state is not applicable. For example, if the asset is not assigned to any role, organization, or anyone.

      This field is commonly used when the asset is a part of a skid, structural tank, or switchgear cabinet, in which the asset parent in the system hierarchy should be the line entity. As such we will using this field to track that the asset is also a part of a physical assembly. We would also be using this field to capture a serialized rotating component as a part of another discrete asset. This field can also be used to indicate an asset membership in a Defined Collection of Assets.

      Note that this property is populated automatically, and not available for user to edit. Use-case: asset from the GIS will not be indexed on the hierarchy. The main use of this property is to provide a simple handle term, when one needs to summarize the collection of all assets imported from a certain layer(s) the GIS.

    type: validation
    specification: |
      if both of the following properties are null
          - (asset_x.properties."first date of City operation")
          - (asset_x.properties."warranty start date")
        then the value of (asset_x.properties."operating_state") CANNOT be "available (up)"

  #========================

  - name: asset can be assigned exlcusively to either a role, user, or user group
    id: EkD-ZmIceg
    type: validation
    specification: | 
      only one of the following properties can have value (i.e., not null) at any given time. (It is also okay for all of them to be null) 
          - asset_x.properties."assigned_to_role"
          - asset_x.properties."assigned_to_tool_user"

    errorMessage: "Between \"assigned_to_role\", \"assigned_to_tool_user_group\", \"installed\"assigned_to_tool_user\", every asset may only have one type assignment."

          - asset_x.properties."assigned_to_tool_user_group"           
        then the value of (asset_x.properties."operating_state") must be "not assigned work". The opposite must also be true.
    errorMessage: "An asset NOT assigned to a role, user, or user group should not be operating and therefore would not have an operating_state"

          asset_x.properties."assigned_to_tool_user" = null
