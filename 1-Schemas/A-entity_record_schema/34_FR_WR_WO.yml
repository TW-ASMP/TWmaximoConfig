      PMs should be organized into a PM-set when they are meant to be performed at different times.  For example the PMs for substation line 1 and line 2 maintenance are performed on alternating years. They can be organize into a PM-Set named Main Substation Maintenance. PMs should be organized under a parent PM if they are parts of the same larger continuous process - represented by the parent - such as the winter shutdown maintenance of island treatment plant.
